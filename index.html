An essential wing of the School infrastructure, the auditoria serve multiple purposes throughout the year. The South Point School auditorium can seat 300-plus people while the capacity at High School is 200-plus. Regular recreational activities and celebrations at the auditoria include the Investiture Ceremony, Christmas Parties, Inter-House Competitions, Rabindra Jayanti, Teachers’ Day Celebrations, co-curricular classes, career counselling sessions, seminars and workshops for teachers and pupils as well as the daily Assemblies. The auditoria are the nerve centres of School, of a large number of educational, cultural and social functions. While they are easily accessible from all classrooms, activities at the auditoria do not disturb teaching and learning in any of them.</p>

                    <p> Rabindranath Tagore is being remembered by the pupils of South Point High School on his 80th death anniversary on the 7 th of August or “Baishe Srabon” (according to the Bengali calendar), through a Bandish to create a proper mood, based on “Raag – Gour Malhar” followed by a Rabindrasangeet based on the same “Raag”, depicting the poet’s favourite rainy season. Most of Tagore’s songs were influenced by Hindustani Classical Music but blended with his own style. They are similar in overall structure to the “raags” but not the same. He would often modify a “Raag” to suit his lyrical requirements and his compositions became unique.</p>
